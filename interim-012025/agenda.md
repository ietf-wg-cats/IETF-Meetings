## Notes

### Use Case I-Ds

* Recall that this document paints a picture of some key use cases. It is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all use cases that will ever be applicable.
Further, it is not a "proof of necessity" for CATS -- we already have a working group!
* Our objective should be to get the working group use-case draft ready for a consensus call as "complete", with that call to be held immediately after Bangkok
* Does the WG want to push for RFC publication, or just tag the I-D as having consensus
* For all other use-case-related I-Ds:
  - Are they already included in the WG use-case draft? If so, can we "close" the other draft?
  - Should they be included in the WG use-case draft as main use cases or as "future uses" for the appendix?

### Metrics

* Follow up on the adoption poll discussion
* Decide on next steps
* Can we start to quantify the amount of information and how often it varies?
